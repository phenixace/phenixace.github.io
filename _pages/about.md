I am currently a visiting scholar at The BlueWhale Lab, National University of Singapore (NUS), and a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computing (COMP), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (funded by **HKPFS**). Prior to joining PolyU, I received my Master's degree in Information Technology (with Distinction) from the University of Melbourne, under the supervision of Dr. Lea Frermann. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021.

My research interests lie in **Natural Language Processing**, **Drug Discovery**, and **Large Language Models**. I have published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including CVPR, ACL, IJCAI, and IEEE TKDE. I served as a Program Committee member of AAAI 2024 & 2025, and as a reviewer for ICML, NeurIPS, and ICLR.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
