I am currently a Ph.D. candidate of the Department of Computing (COMP), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (funded by **HKPFS**). Before joining the PolyU, I received my Master degree of Information Technology (with Distinction) from the University of Melbourne, under the supervision of Dr. Lea Frermann. In 2021, I got my bachelor degree of Information Security from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am a self-motivated person and have strong passion for scientific research. Currently, my research interest lies in Natural Language Processing, Drug Discovery, and Recommender Systems. I have published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals, such as CVPR, ACL, IJCAI, and IEEE TKDE. I served as Program Committee of AAAI 2024 and AAAI 2025 and I am also a reviewer of several top-tier conferences and journals, such as ICML, Neurips and ICLR. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you are interested in my research or have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
